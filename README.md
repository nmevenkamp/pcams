# PCA-MS
Variational Multi-Phase Segmentation using High-Dimensional Local Features
---
[b]Description[/b]
A variational multi-phase segmentation framework based on the Mumford-Shah energy, combined with PCA-based dimension reduction is used to segment color or gray-value images into regions of different structure identified by high-dimensional features, such as local spectral histograms (for Texture) and localized Fourier transforms (for Crystals).
