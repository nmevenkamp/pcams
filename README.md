### PCA-MS: Variational Multi-Phase Segmentation using High-Dimensional Local Features
___
A **variational multi-phase segmentation** framework based on the **Mumford-Shah** energy, combined with **PCA**-based dimension reduction is used to segment color or gray-value images into regions of different structure identified by **high-dimensional features**, such as **local spectral histograms (Texture)** or **localized Fourier transforms (Crystals)**.
